## 🚀 Getting Started

### What You Can Do

-   View and browse your chromatin traces as 3D models
-   Inspect the distance between readouts easily
-   Inspect the perimeter of any three readouts
-   Filter linkage with a given distance threshold
-   Distance heatmap
-   Distance to the geometric center
-   Radius of Gyration

## 📁 Supported File Types

### Input Formats

Please ensure your CSV file contains the following required columns (case-insensitive):

- Either **fov, s, readout, x, y, z**
- Or **fov, trace, readout, x, y, z**

extra columns are ignored

### Sample Data
Click to download an example CSV file: [sample.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20494724/sample.csv)

#### Sample data details
The sample dataset include three field of views (FOV):
- FOV1: one allele with no missing values
- FOV2: five alleles with no missing values
- FOV3: one allele WITH missing values

### Data pre-process

This program is using linear interpolation to impute the missing values.
When the interpolation switch is off by default, the missing readouts are colored gray on the model and the distance heatmap.

## 📋 How to Use

### Step 1: Upload Your CSV File

1.   Click the button to start uploading. ![Frame 15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9445d938-a7a5-4154-a4bc-9950ab0c7493)

2.   Enter the number of Total Readouts. **This step is required** in order to fill in all the missing values. All the alleles will have this number of total readouts. You can enter other genomics infomation to display them on the distance map.<img width="2085" height="1089" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79489cae-7bbb-43ea-b139-ee7c4e4f1c90" />
