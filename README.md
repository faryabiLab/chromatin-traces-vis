## üöÄ Getting Started

### What You Can Do

-   View and browse your chromatin traces as 3D models
-   Inspect the distance between readouts easily
-   Inspect the perimeter of any three readouts
-   Filter linkage with a given distance threshold
-   Distance heatmap
-   Distance to the geometric center
-   Radius of Gyration

## üìÅ Supported File Types

### Input Formats

Please ensure your CSV file contains the following required columns (case-insensitive):

- Either **fov, s, readout, x, y, z**
- Or **fov, trace, readout, x, y, z**

extra columns are ignored

### Sample Data
Click to download an example CSV file: [sample.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20494724/sample.csv)

#### Sample data details
The sample dataset include three field of views (FOV):
- FOV1: one allele with no missing values
- FOV2: five alleles with no missing values
- FOV3: one allele WITH missing values

### Data pre-process

This program is using linear interpolation to impute the missing values.

## üìã How to Use

### Step 1: Upload Your CSV File

1.   Click the button to start uploading. ![Frame 15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9445d938-a7a5-4154-a4bc-9950ab0c7493)

2.   Enter the number of Total Readouts. **This step is required** in order to fill in all the missing values. All the alleles will have this number of total readouts. ![Frame 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c375384-c032-4dd4-ba2a-4be650d29687)


3.   Drop your CSV file or click to upload. Your file **WILL NOT** be saved to our database.<img width="1799" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26a864b4-0a14-4499-b4c4-aedb98cd06e0" />
